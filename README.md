# Industrial Parks in Israel Data Analysis 
This repository contains a data analysis project focusing on industrial parks in Israel. This analysis utilizes Python and various techniques to analyze the data and draw meaningful conclusions. It also provides useful visualizations and insights into the data.

## Results
In the Exploratory Data Analysis, I found that the south of Israel receives the most funding from the Ministry of Economy (Israel). Additionally, I found that the remaining data was not interesting enough to draw meaningful insights.
